#terrehbyte-math-library
Welcome to the TBYTE math library, a small and simple set of functions and classes that allow for easy understanding of mathematical concepts required for game development. While this limits versatility, the ease of basic use reduces the fearsomeness of the learning curve. Finally, this can serve as a stepping stone for larger math libraries such OpenGL Mathematics (GLM).

#Documentation

For documentation, see the [Github wiki](https://github.com/terrehbyte/terrehbyte-math-library/wiki "TBYTE Wiki") for usage examples and descriptive one-liners of each class and its member functions.

#Contributions

Forks and pull requests are more than welcome and are encouraged.

Keeping in mind that this originated as a class project, a loose coding standard applies. Hungarian notation is primarily used for primitive types such as 'int' or 'bool'. There is no notation for this library's classes. That said, they should be stored in the "tbyte" namespace.
